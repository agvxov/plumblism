 <center><h1>The NetPBM Image File Formats</h1></center>
 
 The PBMplus file formats were developed by Jef Poskanzer as a
 means of including images into e-mail messages long before such
 things as MIME types were popular. But since then they have
 become very popular amongst computer graphics and computer vision
 people for image input and output. After Poskanzer stopped
 maintaining the formats, the net gathered it up, with corrections,
 extensions and additions and created NetPBM.
 <p>
 The formats are extremely simple, and have absolutely no advanced
 features. There is no data compression. This simplicity makes
 it easy to code programs that can read large
 collections of existing images or write images that can be
 immediately used by others.
 <h2>Image Types</h2>
 PBMplus is actually a collection of 6 very similar formats that
 can be classified in two ways: by image type and by data type.
 
 <p>
 The formats describe three types of images: black and white
 bitmaps, gray scale images, and full color images. 
 <p>Bitmaps are usually called PBM files and often have a
 <samp>.pbm</samp> extension. (A specific extension is
 <em>not</em> required for any of the PBMplus formats.) In this
 format, a <samp>1</samp> means black and <samp>0</samp> means
 white. 
 
 <p>Grayscale images in the PBMplus formats are referred to as PGM
 files, with a <samp>.pgm</samp> extension. Grayscale intensities
 are integer values going from 0 for black up to a maximum value
 for white specified in the image itself. 
 <p>Color images are called PPM files, and usually have a
 <samp>.ppm</samp> extension. Pixels in PPM files are given as
 integer amounts of red, green, and blue, on a scale from 0 to a
 maximum value given in the file.
 <p>The data in each image type can be stored in either ASCII or
 binary form.
 <h2>Format</h2>
 Each PBMplus image file consists of a header followed by the image
 data for the image.
 <h2>Headers</h2>
 Each PBMplus image file has a ASCII header that consists of three
 parts, one of which is optional depending on the image type.
 <h3>Magic</h3>
 The first part of the header consists of a unique identifying string,
 colloquially known as the file magic, which identifies the file as a
 PBMplus image file. The magic for these files consists of the
 uppercase character <samp>P</samp>, followed by an ASCII digit 1
 through 6. These characters <em>must</em> be the first two
 characters in the file. The magic values can be summarized in the
 table below:
 <p></p><center>
 <table border=1 cellpadding=5 summary="PBMplus file magic">
 <caption>PBMplus file magic values</caption>
 <tbody><tr><td><td>ASCII<td>Binary</tr>
 <tr><td>B/W (pbm)<td><samp>P1</samp><td><samp>P4</samp></tr>
 <tr><td>Grayscale (pgm)<td><samp>P2</samp><td><samp>P5</samp></tr>
 <tr><td>Color (ppm)<td><samp>P3</samp><td><samp>P6</samp></tr>
 </table>
 </center>
 Whitespace separates the magic characters from the sections
 below. A single new line character is often used.
 
 <h3>Size</h3>
 The second part of the header consists of two numerical ASCII
 values that give the width and height, respectively, of the image
 in pixels.
 
 <h3>Intensity</h3>
 The last part of the header is a positive numerical ASCII value which
 indicates the maximum possible value that a pixel can have. In
 the case of color images, it is the maximum value that a red,
 green or blue component of a pixel may have. In black and white
 images this value is not needed. In binary grayscale and color
 images (P5 and P6), this intensity value can never be greater than
 255. ASCII files do not have this restriction.
 <h3>Comments</h3>
 The header of a PBMplus image is allowed to have comments, which
 are ignored by a program processing the file. Comments consist of
 the # character and continue until the end of the line. The
 comment may not come before the magic. There are no comments
 after the intensity value in a binary file. Comments are allowed
 in the image data section of an ASCII file. Multiple line
 comments are allowed as long as each line starts with a #
 character.
 <h2>Image Data and Types</h2>
 The format of the image data for each image type is described
 below. The image data describes the intensity values for the
 image pixels in row major order. The image origin is in the upper
 left hand corner and proceeds in positive x to the right and and
 positive y towards the bottom. The first pixel value will be the
 pixel in the top left corner of the image. The next pixel value
 will be to the right of that and so on until all the values of the
 topmost pixel row are given. These are followed immediately by
 the values of the second row and so on until the bottom of the
 image is reached.<p>
 
 <h3>Black and White ASCII (P1)</h3>
 After the header, the intensity values of the pixels are given as
 sequences of the ASCII characters 1 and 0. There may or may not
 be white space between these characters. The value 1 represents
 black and the value 0 represents white. Comments are allowed in
 the image data.
 <h3>Grayscale ASCII (P2)</h3>
 After the header, the intensity values of the pixels are given as
 ASCII numbers separated by whitespace. Comments are allowed in the
 image data.
 <h3>Color ASCII (P3)</h3>
 After the header, the values of each pixel are given as 3 ASCII
 numbers representing the red, green, and blue components of the
 pixel. The componenets are separated by white space as are the
 pixel values themselves. Comments are allowed in the image data.
 <h3>Black and White Binary (P4)</h3>
 After the height of the image is given in the header, one
 character of white space is allowed. This is usually a newline
 character. The image data bytes immediately follow. Each byte in
 this format represents eight pixels, with 1 bits representing
 black and 0 bits representing white. The bits are in
 little-endian order, i.e., the most significant bit is to the left and
 the least significant bit is to the right. No comments are
 allowed in the image data.
 <h3>Grayscale Binary (P5)</h3>
 After the maximum intensity value of the image is given in the
 header, one character of whitespace is allowed, usually a newline
 character. The image data immediately follows, one byte per pixel
 value. No space or comments of any kind are allowed in the image
 data section. All characters are treated as intensities corresponding
 to their ASCII values. Because there is a correspondence of one
 byte per pixel, the maximum allowed intensity value can be no greater
 than 255.
 <h3>Color Binary (P6)</h3>
 After the maximum intensity value of the image is given in the
 header, exactly one character of whitespace is allowed, usually a
 newline character. The image data immediately follows, three bytes
 per pixel value. The three bytes represent the red, green and blue
 values of the pixel respectively. No space or comments of any kind
 are allowed in the image data section.
 <h2>Commentary</h2>
 Here is a brief summary about some of the pros and cons of ASCII
 and binary PBMplus files and of the format in general:
 <ul>
 <li> ASCII files are <em>huge</em>. There can be as many as 4
 bytes to describe the intensity value of a single pixel or
 component. Color <samp>ppm</samp> images could easily have at least
 12 bytes per pixel. In ASCII <samp>pbm</samp> files there are at least
 8 bytes per pixel.
 <li> ASCII files can allow sample values greater than 255. This
 can be very important in applications where high intensity
 resolution is needed, such as medical imaging or cinematic
 special effects.
 <li> This format has no means to represent indexed color images.
 <li> This format has no compression.
 <li> This format has no means to represent
 "transparent" values which are very useful in creating
 shaped images such as icons.
 <li> ASCII files are readable by humans and can be easily
 included in generic e-mail messages. With today's MIME types
 for e-mail attachments, this is no longer an issue.
 <li> Binary files are not readable by humans. But usually only
 the header is of human interest.
